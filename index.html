title: Julien Beaulieu's Blog on Data Science and Productivity
---



My name is Julien and I am a Data Scientist. 

<br />
<br />
I transitioned from online marketing to data science in 2019. I am a self-taught practionner currently self-employed.
<br />
<br />

I am passionate about deep learning with a focus on NLP, computer vision and software engineering. I created my own curriculum (linked below) from top online courses and resources. 
<br />
<br />
I decided to create this website to have somewhere to write about my projects and ideas related to learning data science.

<br />
<br />
I have a passion for traveling, <a href="https://www.julienbeaulieu.com">taking pictures</a>, chess, and food.  

<br />
<br />

Thanks for reading!
