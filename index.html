title: Julien Beaulieu's Blog on Data Science and Productivity

My name is Julien and I am an aspiring Data Scientist. 

<br />
<br />
Over the past months, I have made a whole collection of conscious choices to move my professional competencies from online marketing analytics to an area I am increasingly passionate about: machine learning and AI.

<br />
This started when I quit my job in mid 2018 to take some time to think about my future. I then took part-time online courses in python and machine learning to see if I would like it, while also independently doing consulting work in my former profession. My curiosity turned into a real passion, and around May 2019, I decided that data science was what I was going to pursue full time. 
Today I am building my own curriculum through a combination of online courses, books, articles, and projects, taking advantage of all the incredible resources that are available in the field. 

<br />
<br />
I believe in the top down approach of learning by doing. In the importance of learning how to learn in order to become an expert. In investing in continuous learning throughout a lifetime and in adapting to market tendencies, technology trends as well as personal passions.

<br />
Hence why I quit my job. Why I got interested in data science. And why I am switching careers even if the path from a non-technical profession to a highly technical one is daunting, time consuming and difficult.  

<br />
<br />
I decided to create this website to have somewhere to write. I have a passion for traveling, <a href="https://www.julienbeaulieu.com">taking pictures</a>, chess, and food.
