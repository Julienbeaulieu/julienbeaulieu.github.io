title: Julien Beaulieu's Blog on Data Science and Productivity
---



My name is Julien and I am an aspiring Data Scientist. 
Over the past 12 months, I have made a whole collection of conscious choices to move my professional competencies to an area I am increasingly passionate about: AI and machine learning. 
What has pushed me to pursue this change comes from the following mindset: Understand reality. Invest in continuous learning. Adapt. Add new/different value. Rinse and repeat.  
I am learning data science and building my own curriculum.  
<br />
I decided to create this website to have somewhere to write. I have a passion for traveling, <a href="https://www.julienbeaulieu.com">taking pictures</a>, chess, and food.
