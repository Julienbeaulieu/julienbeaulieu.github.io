title: Julien Beaulieu's Blog on Data Science and Productivity
---



My name is Julien and I am an aspiring Data Scientist. 

<br />
<br />
Over the past months, I have made a whole collection of conscious choices to move my professional competencies from online marketing analytics to an area I am increasingly passionate about: machine learning and AI. 

<br />
<br />

Today I am building my own curriculum through a combination of online courses, books, articles, and projects, taking advantage of all the incredible resources that are available in the field. 

<br />
<br />
I decided to create this website to have somewhere to write.

<br />
<br />
I have a passion for traveling, <a href="https://www.julienbeaulieu.com">taking pictures</a>, chess, and food.  

<br />

Thanks for reading!
