Hey there! My name is Julien and I am an aspiring Data Scientist. I decided to create this website to have somewhere to publish what I write. I also have a passion for traveling, <a href="https://www.julienbeaulieu.com">taking pictures</a>, chess, and food.  

<br />

Add me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julienbeaulieu/">LinkedIn</a> if you're interested to chat. 

<br />

Thanks for reading!
