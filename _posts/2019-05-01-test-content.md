I am an aspiring Data Scientist currently looking for a job. This article is about how I am transitioning into the field coming from a non-technical business background. In writing this, I hope to give the motivation and inspiration to people in similar situations to take on this journey as well. 

I will first share some background about myself, why and how I chose this career. I will then explain the path I chose to pursue my education, as well as lessons learned. Finally, I’ll share some resources that I think have been essential in getting a toehold in Data Science. 

Feel free to skip directly to the parts you are most interested in. 
</br>
</br>
## Why do I want to Become a Data Scientist? 

I am a geek at heart and I have long been fascinated by the world of technology, science, and video games. While coding was something I was interested in, I never really considered a career in it. 

After a masters in e-commerce at a business school and a few stints at various online marketing companies, I joined GSoft which is a startup based in Montreal. Aside from being a great place to work, GSoft had a keen interest in keeping its employees and products abreast of the cutting-edge technologies, particularly AI. As such, they hosted hackathons and training events, always focused on the power of data and how best to use it to drive the business forward. These events woke up the engineer in me I'd never known was there. It was at that point that I developed a passion for data. I decided I wanted to learn how to code and to pursue a career in Data Science.  

Data Science is currently a hot career, so I naturally wanted to make sure it wasn’t just hype and that it was truly for me. I started to do extensive research by reading a lot of articles, books, speaking to data scientists, and going to events. This finally culminated in my taking a consulting role in the more data driven part of the business at a bank all while I pursued a more formal education in data technology. I enrolled in an online bootcamp at <a href="https://rmotr.com/data-science-python-course">Rmotr</a>, which is focused on programming in Python and learning the Python libraries for Data Science.  

So far, I have been consistently blown away by the number and power of tools already at a data scientist’s disposal, constantly cementing the notion that this is the career for me. To quote Andrew Ng, Data Science and deep learning is “the new electricity”.  The deeper I get, the more I understand where he's coming from, and the more I want to share my insights into this exciting and high impact field with anyone who may be in the situation I was in so recently. 
</br>
</br>
## How I Plan on Becoming a Data Scientist  

Changing careers requires a lot of time, effort and money, so it’s important to carefully and meticulously evaluate all possible options.  

There are three different approaches to learning data science that I have been considering:  

* Option 1 – Get a job as a data analyst – which would be easier to get into - and learn Data Science on the job and/or on the side. There is a difference between a data analyst and a data scientist. If you’re confused about the differences, read XYZ which is a great summary. Fundamentally, however, a data analyst does X while a data scientist does Y. 
</br>

* Option 2 - Bottom-up approach. Learn the math, statistics and programming first, then move on to more complex machine learning subjects. All traditional university programs fall into this bucket, although you can certainly decide to learn this way on your own as well.  
</br>

* Option 3 - Top down approach. The focus is on building projects. You first start with a practical problem you want to solve, or a project you want to build. You then learn the minimum amount of programming and math to be able to complete it and put the work into production. Bootcamps, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), self-taught learning through online videos and books fall in this category. 
</br>

All options are completely valid and are each better suited for different types of people and circumstances. After much reflection, I decided to take option 3: a non-academic, self-taught path.  

I like James Kobielus’ insight in his article <a href="https://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/data-scientist-closing-talent-gap">Closing the Talent Gap</a>: 

> “There’s yet another trend that will alleviate any talent gap: the democratization of Data Science. While I agree wholeheartedly with Raden’s statement that ‘the crème-de-la-crème of data scientists will fill roles in academia, technology vendors, Wall Street, research and government,’ I think he’s understating the extent to which autodidacts – the self-taught, uncredentialed, data-passionate people – will come to play a significant role in many organizations’ Data Science initiatives.” 

I agree with his opinion that academic credentials are important but not necessary for high-quality Data Science (or simply to get a job). The core aptitudes – curiosity, intellectual agility, statistical fluency, research stamina, scientific rigor, a skeptical nature – that distinguish the best data scientists are all things you can acquire on the job, and by working smart. 
</br>
</br>
## 10 lessons learned during my time learning Data Science 

<b>1. There is a great opportunity for me in this field as someone from a non-technical background.</b> 

What I mean is that my unique background can play into my advantage since there are less people in the field with my business experience and perspective. As a marketing professional, I am innately customer-focused, always asking the questions, who’s it for, what’s it for, and how can I get people excited about it and spread the word. I also understand the importance of stakeholders, always thinking about how much impact my initiatives will have on the bottom line.  

I also had the opportunity to work in an agile environment in a startup. Lean production and iteration cycles, constant improvement and prioritization are all concepts I apply in my day to day work.  

I believe that this background that can be effectively used and applied in Data Science, and that these are skills that are typically lacking in the field.  
</br>

<b>2. Data Science is difficult but not inaccessible.</b>

While Data Science may seem intimidating to some, what many don’t realize is just how accessible it is thanks to the democratization of resources: video courses, eBooks, Stack Overflow, GitHub, hackathons, meetups, etc., most of which are free and open. What is required is dedication, as well as hard and smart work. Thankfully, this is something I can perform quite well.  

Data Science is a relatively new career trajectory that merges statistics, business logic, and programming knowledge. This makes it a quite a difficult challenge, especially for a non-technical person like myself. A lot of people that transition into the field seem to be engineers or PHDs. They either already know how to program, have an extensive math background, or both. Having said that, there is still a sizable amount of people from non-technical backgrounds that have had successful careers.  
</br>

<b>3. Time to first job matters most.</b>

The sooner I am in a team working on actual Data Science projects, the sooner I’ll learn about it. I’ll be working on real problems, problems that sometimes classes can't teach that don’t always have to do with statistical complexity. I’ll have management invested in me and I’ll see what it really means to do practical Data Science.   
</br>

<b>4. Project focused learning will land me a job faster than the academic route.</b> 

According Dan Becker, a data scientist at Kaggle that has overseen the recruitment of hundreds of people in the field, the quickest way to be hired as a data scientist is to build projects and showcase them to employers. This is because we learn much faster by trying and building something that solves a real problem. It is for me the most efficient and motivating way to learn. It is when you truly understand why certain math concepts are important that you remember them best. 

It also sends a signal: I am showing that I am interested and passionate enough that I am building things that are useful (hopefully!) on my own time.  

From what I have gathered, employers don’t really care that much if you know how to program or know math. They would rather see what problems I have identified and created a solution for and how passionate I am about the work. 

One key concept to have in mind while doing this is to build the minimum viable version of the project and not spend too much time on it trying to make it perfect. My code doesn’t have to be great, it just has to work. If the project ends up being promising and gets traction, maybe I can go back and improve it, make it scale, and update my code. Otherwise, it’s best to move and learn something new.
</br>

<b>5. Time and Money.</b> 

Another important reason behind my decision is that getting a college degree is expensive and takes a very long time. I am fortunate enough to live in Montreal where there are cheap, relatively fast and quality options. Unfortunately, none have all three at the same time. The Masters in Management in Analytics at McGill University is only a year, but costs 45,000 CAD. Data Science graduate degree at Montreal’s School of Commerce is only 6000$ thanks to government subsidies but takes about 1.5 to 2 years to complete and I could only start in August or January.  

This leaves me with online options (moving cities is not an option at this point). Lambda School seems to have a fantastic program – I have talked to many alumni and they all gave excellent feedback on the school. However, I am not eligible for their financing options because I don’t live in the US. Therefore, it’s 26,000 CAD to join the program.  

A cheaper and faster way is to make my own curriculum through a combination of MOOCs, bootcamps, free online resources, books meetups and competitions. See my list of resources I am using at the end of the article.  
</br>

<b>6. I can choose what I get to work on and study.</b>

There are so many good learning options out there, so many great lectures and videos that are available for free or for relatively cheap, that it would in fact be more effective for me to learn this way. By learning on an as-needed basis, I study what I actually need, and don’t spend time on topics that may end up being irrelevant. 
</br>

<b>7. Creating a network.</b>

This is definitely something a school will give you that (most) online classes won’t. One way I make up for this is to simply reach out to people over lunch or coffee. It’s been going great so far. It’s surprising the number of people who are happy to take some time out of their schedule and help out. Also, it’s important that I continue networking at local Data Science events and go to conferences.
</br>

<b>8. Understanding what the best way for me to learn is and making the most of it.</b>

I know my weaknesses and strengths when it comes to learning. I’ve been learning things on the side and I’ve had many side projects ever since I started my professional career 8 years ago. I know I am a self-starter, that I have the discipline to teach myself things outside of a classroom or a work environment. Therefore, I know I am getting into something that I can succeed in and complete. 
</br>

<b>9. Immersing myself in the community.</b>

My favorite and most effective way to learn is to surround myself with all things Data Science. This is done by subscribing to Data Science newsletters, reading articles and books, listening to podcasts, watching videos on YouTube, taking advantage of sites like <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a> and <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a> by attending all and any Data Science events, finding online communities on reddit, Slack, and LinkedIn and joining them. 
</br>

<b>10. Math.</b>

My approach to math is as follows: I need to know the science and math behind what’s going on with data or else I’ll be extremely limited in what I can learn. Math will be increasingly important for me the more I advance my career. The tools and tech will continue to change rapidly, but the underlying math will not. Having said this, you don’t need an extensive foundation in math to begin working on projects. 
</br>

<b>11. Diversity.</b>

One last thing I’ll mention about the field that really appeals to me: there is an incredible diversity of the people in Data Science; more so than in any other technical field I know as a matter of fact. Data scientists come from the widest variety of backgrounds; from mathematics, physics, economy, engineering, to business and social sciences. These are people from all over the world, men and women alike.  

I believe this is one of the field’s greatest strengths. Countless studies have found that diverse teams perform better. I just cannot wait to work with PHDs, engineers and other incredibly smart people. Man is that exciting! 
</br>
</br>
## Next Steps

This is what my plan looks like in a few bullet points. I’ll be learning Data Science full time and using the resources I list below. 

- Learn the minimum necessary for an interesting and practical project (Kaggle competitions, Data for Good, personal projects) and join a MOOC that is focused on building projects. In my case I enrolled in Udacity’s Data Science Nanodegree program which seems fantastic! Check out their syllabus.  

    - Showcase my projects widely (GitHub, Kaggle, Reddit community, friends, contacts, etc). Get feedback! 

    - Improve them based on feedback and traction or interest. 

    - Learn more theory as needed. 

- Projects can be an interesting starting point for networking – Find people interested in it, or that have worked on similar projects and have a discussion. Talk to potential employers about them too. 

- Repeat these steps to create a portfolio.
