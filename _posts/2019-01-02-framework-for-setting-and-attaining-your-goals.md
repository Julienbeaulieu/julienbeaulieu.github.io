## Keeping track of progress

This year, for the first time, I have decided to write down the things I want to accomplish and to track my progress. After spending a lot of time thinking of what I want to do in life, what my long-term goals and dreams are, I now want to find a framework to help me achieve my goals in the most effective way possible. I am usually pretty good at sticking to my resolutions, and if I say I’m going to do something, I usually do it. 

One issue I currently have is this: it is now the end of the year and I have trouble determining if the past year was a success or not. I think is it! Maybe? But to what extent? Wouldn’t it be great if I could look back and see where I have succeeded and failed, and to what degree? This way, I could use that data for personal improvement and to make even better objectives and an improved goal-reaching system for next year. Doing so is important to me because it will help get me closer to my life goals. I am referring to life goals at large, not just professionally speaking. This includes health, family & girlfriend related goals, reading and writing, hobbies, etc.  

## Measure What Matters

This initiative was triggered following a book I recently read: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221">Measure What Matters</a>. The author John Doerr describes a popular management system used by companies like Google, Intel or Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to keep track of business objectives and increase the odds they’ll succeed at achieving them. The method they describe in the book are OKRs, which stands for Objective, Key Results. I love the approach, and thought that some of the principles would nicely apply to my own life.   

Therefore, I have decided to take a methodological approach to defining and writing down my objectives as an experiment, hoping that this will increase my chances of succeeding at them. I am sharing a framework that was influenced by the book, but also influenced by the work I do as a marketer specializing in growth, data analytics and conversion rate optimization.

## Why set objectives in the first place?  

Defining objectives for my personal life has helped surface what is important for me to achieve and has helped me think about my future, as well as things I want to accomplish. It also helps channel my efforts in determining what I should be working on instead of blindly starting the year and focusing on things that don’t matter. Objectives point us in the direction we want to go and impel us to make hard choices.

I anticipate that having clear, specific, ambitious objectives will produce a higher level of productivity, will create clarity and increase my engagement towards reaching those goals.

## Definition of OKRs and leading principles 

I use the OKR model to define my objectives so here is a definition taken directly from the book: 

> “Objectives: This is simply WHAT is to be achieved, no more, and no less. By definition, objectives are significant, concrete, action oriented and (ideally), inspirational. 

> Key results: benchmark and monitor HOW we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and timebound, aggressive yet realistic. Most of all they are measurable and verifiable. You either meet a key result’s requirements or you don’t.” John Doerr 

OKR is a system used in a business context, and since I’ve decided to take some of the concepts and apply them to my own life, I found that there are three core OKR aspects that are useful to follow:  

1. <b>Write down my objectives.</b> It’s been proven again and again, the simple act of writing down a goal increases the chances of reaching it. That alone it is not enough however: I think most people stop here but it is possible to take things a little further.  

2. <b>Track and monitor progress.</b> This step really helps staying engaged and not quit early. I’ll know how well I am measuring up, and if I can speak from professional experience, I will be motivated to put extra effort to reach my objectives. I’ll also know what went well, and what needs more work or attention. On top of this, since I have also prioritized my goals, I’ll know if I am on right track or if I’m spending too much time on things that provide little value. 

3. <b>Share my goals with friends and colleagues.</b> This will make me accountable. It will create <a href="https://seths.blog/2017/05/tension-vs-fear/">tension</a> and push me to stay engaged and motivated because now people are looking.  

> “In one California study, people who recorded their goals and sent weekly progress reports to a friend - [two integral OKR features] - attained 43 percent more of their objectives than those who merely thought about goals without sharing them”. John Doerr

## Other things to consider during the process 

### Goals should be adaptable 

> “If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just gets us to the wrong place faster.” Steven Covey 

Goals should be adaptable by nature. They’re meant to be guardrails, not chains or blinders. As I track and review my objectives, I can choose to update an objective, start a new one or stop pursuing one entirely if the context has change. There is no point spending time on something that isn’t relevant anymore. Best is to discard it and put my focus elsewhere. I plan to review my goals every three months.

### Retrospection on goals 

> “OKRS do not expire with completion of the work. As in any data-driven system, tremendous value can be gained from post hoc evaluation and analysis.” John Doerr 

Regular self-assessment and reflection on my objectives will be done to uncover learnings. I intend to reflect on my objectives every three months and write an analysis at the end of the year.   

Here are examples of questions to answer:  
- Did I accomplish all of my objectives? If so, what contributed to my success?  

- If not, what obstacles did I encounter?  

- If I were to rewrite a goal achieved in full, what would I change?  

- What have I learned that might alter my approach to the next cycle’s objectives? 

It’s also important to take some time to think about the long-term plan. Are my OKRs still relevant to my life goals? Am I still doing the right thing? Has anything changed that would require me to add or remove OKRs? I believe this check in is vital and should not be skipped.   

### An iterative and incremental process 

Every process requires trial and error. This is my first iteration of creating a system that will hopefully lead me to be more productive throughout the year. And not necessarily because I will be working harder. Rather, the productivity gain will be a result of my increased focus on what matters most. 

As I iterate through different goal setting systems, improving them and fitting them to my needs, I will find the formula that works best for me.  

Even the most successful companies don’t get it right the first time either. “<i>An organization may need up to four or five quarterly cycles to fully embrace the system, and even more than that to build mature goal muscle.</i>” John Doerr.  

If you are interested in trying, I put together a Google spreadsheet template where you can list your OKRs. Check it out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KUPTNNB78ZOrR8OyTC5EirrOW_6yJZvSyfYzZhFGnMs/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. The template is based off my own goals but I didn't include them all for privacy reasons.   

Still haven’t thought about your goals? Don’t worry it’s never too late to start. New Years is just an excuse. Goal setting is ongoing, and I encourage you to start now.
