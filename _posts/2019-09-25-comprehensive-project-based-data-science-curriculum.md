## Summary

The curriculum presented here offers a mix of best in class resources and a suggested path to complete them in order to become a data scientist. It is intended to be a **complete education in data science** using online materials and is an alternative to getting a Masters degree. All resources have been heavily researched and used by myself in my journey of becoming a Data Scientist & a Deep Learning practitioner.

**Who is this for?**

The following education assumes no prior knowledge of data science, programming, and only assumes knowledge of basic high school math. For this reason, it is intended for anyone who is currently in a completely unrelated field that wants to fully transition careers and get hired as a data scientist (I used to be a digital marketer). 

If you have experience with machine learning already but are looking to refine your skills, you can also use this curriculum and start directly at the Deep Learning module and hand pick what you find interesting throughout.  

This curriculum does assume however that you are extremely eager to learn, are self driven, and motivated because a lot of the resources are self-paced. Completing the curriculum end to end will easily take over a year. That said, this education goes much deeper than a boot camp and will give you more hands on experience than most Masters degree.   

This curriculum is inspired by [OSSU's](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) amazing self-taught, open source education in Computer Science. 

**Why choose a self-taught education?**

- Abundance of high quality resources: This curriculum includes a lot of courses from top universities (MIT, Stanford, University of San Francisco) as well as MOOCs that have been taken by millions of students and that have received outstanding reviews (Deeplearning.ai, Fastai, Le Wagon). 
- Focus on state of the art techniques: there aren't many university courses and boot camps that teach state of the art techniques such as ones found in [Fastai](https://fast.ai) or at Standford's CS224n Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing.  
- Flexibility: easy to pursue or continue part time if you find a job during the process. 
- Passion: You can study and work on projects that you find the most interesting instead of being bound to a particular curriculum for 2 years.  
- Self-starter: A strong requirement is that you have a proven ability to be a self-starter. If that is you, you're in the right place.   

**Objectives with this coursework**

- Work on real world practical projects that you are passionate about. 
- Develop a strong knowledge base in math - this includes Linear algebra, calculus, statistics and probability theory. 
- Become a good developer with solid software engineer and computer science foundations.  
- Read scientific papers and apply them or redo the experiments on your own. 
- Deploy models with elegant and reusable code.
- Get hired as a data scientist, data analyst, or machine learning engineer.

## Curriculum


### Programming Primer & Learning How to Learn

Knowing how to programming is essential for data science. I highly suggest learning Python basics before anything else such as enrolling in a course or boot camp. This way, you'll make the most out of your boot camp/course and concentrate on the data science part. Make sure you are up to speed with the following material before going further. Also, since you are about to engage in a lifetime of learning new things, I highly recommend looking at the resources related to becoming a better learner.

>Note: ❤️s represent material I particularly enjoyed and recommend. 

**Topics covered**:
`Introduction to AI` ,
`Introduction to Python`,
`Learning how to learn`

**Overview**
- Get an overview of what machine learning is with the "Fundamentals of AI" to make sure it a good route for you to pursue. 
- Learn programming basics with a great platform: Codecademy.  
- Since you're about to start an epic learning journey, make sure you know how to apply the best techniques to learn efficiently. Taking "Learning how to learn" on Coursera is a must! The book on which the course is based on, "A Mind for Numbers", and the brilliant "Pragmatic Thinking and Learning" are good complementary options too. For a quick summary of all three resource refer to [this blogpost](https://julienbeaulieu.github.io/2020/05/25/lesser-known-facts-about-learning-how-to-get-better-at-studying/). 

### Core Data Science

This is where you'll improve your coding abilities, math understanding and start working on real data science problems. In this respect, I highly recommend taking what I consider is the best data science boot camp out there: [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/data-science-course/full-time). With a heavy emphasis on practical exercises and a final project in which you get to deploy your own machine learning model, this highly intensive boot camp will give you a big picture data science end to end: just enough theory, data wrangling, data viz, programming inside an IDE, Git, machine learning, deep learning, data engineering. 

Once you understand and have worked on the most important parts of data science, you'll have a better idea of what you like, what your strengths and weaknesses are, and where to head next. This is also an opportunity to build your network. 

Next, check out Fastai's Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders. **I recommend only watching the first 6 lectures which emphasizes tree-based models**. This is because the rest of the videos focus on deep learning which is better covered in their more recent course, listed below. Although this content is 3 years old, don't let that discourage you from watching it: it is taught by one of the the most respected data scientist in the world - Jeremy Howard - and is full of gems.   

Complement your learning with Andriy Burkov's famous The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book to make sure you learn from another perspective, and solidify your understanding in machine learning. 

**Topics covered**:
`Data wrangling`
`Data collection with an API`,
`SQL`,
`Statistical tests & experiments`,
`Data visualization`,
`Machine Learning`,
`Deep Learning`,
`Random Forests`,
`Model interpretation techniques`

### Core Programming

The following resources will help you become a good programmer, software engineer and give you the tools to pass those pesky technical tests that most employers send you during recruitment. I suggest reviewing this material early in your education because being a good programmer will pay off very fast. 

You don't need to go through all of this material in a linear way. Review this on an as-need basis but make sure you're regularly coming back to this material.

Note: keep an eye out for the updated edition of the book which is coming soon.
- If you still aren't comfortable with the shell, version control (Git) and debugging, watch the lectures from MIT's Missing Semester and do the exercises. Really, don't forget to do the exercises!

### Core Math

There is obviously a lot of math involved in machine learning. Some will say that it's not strictly necessary to go deep into math theory and that it's better to focus more on coding. While there is some truth to this, if the end goal is to read, write, implement papers, and to be a true expert in data science, then do not neglect this part. 

I have compiled a list of the best resources to both get started and to go really deep down the math rabit whole, depending on what your needs are.  

**Topics covered**:
`Linear algebra`
`statistics`
`Matrix decompositions`
`Vector calculus`
`Probability and distributions`
`Continuous optimization`
`Dimensionality reduction`
`Density estimation`
`discrete mathematics`
`and more`

**Topics covered**:
`Loss functions and optimization`, 
`Convolutional neural networks`,
`Recurrent neural networks`,
`Deep learning hardware and software`,
`Deep learning for tabular data`,
`NLP`,
`Computer vision`,
`Generative models`,

**Overview**
- Learn how to create state of the art models using the Fastai Library with part 1 of their course. I suggest taking both the Fastai course and the Deep Learning Specialization together since one is more focused on coding while the other is more focused on the theory and math behind it.
- Both Chirs Maning's and Justin Johnson's course (he used to teach the very popular CS231n at Stanford) are world class and will give you deep insights into the worlds of NLP and computer vision. Be sure to do the assignments since they will make you code algorithms from scratch and give you solid foundations to go deeper. 


### Data Engineering

Data Engineering is the foundation for the new world of Big Data. Any good data scientist should know about data engineering and how to deploy models, at least at the most basic level. Very early in your training you should start deploying models from your projects online. These days, employers are looking for these skills and you'll have a better shot a scoring the job than if you only know how to create models.

[SQL](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/) | Mode Analytics 

- Learn to rebuild some Pytorch modules as well as part of the Fastai library from scratch with part 2 of the course. This is also a great lecture in api design and software engineering. 
- If you wish to specialize in machine learning more so than deep learning, look no further than Andrew Ng's notorious machine learning lecture at Stanford.  
- If SQL is important for your projects and current/future job, become an expert with this SQL tutorial. 


### Extras

In addition to all of the above, I suggest doing the following:
- Subscribe to these newsletters: [Andriy Burkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andriyburkov/detail/recent-activity/posts/), [Deeplearning.ai's The Batch](https://www.deeplearning.ai/thebatch/), [DataScienceWeekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/). 
- Regularly explore [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com) to see if there are meetups on topics you are interested in. Since more meetups are currently happening online, you have access to meetups across the entire world. 
- Attend conferences. One I highly suggest going to is [Pycon](https://pycon.org/), even if that means spending a bit of money to attend and travelling to a host city. The value you'll get from it will be worth it.
