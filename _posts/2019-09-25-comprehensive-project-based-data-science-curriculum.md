## Summary

The following is a mix of project orientated learning and theory that I have studied or that I am currently studying. My curriculum is intended to be a **complete education in data science** using online materials. I am currently studying this full time.

This curriculum is inspired by [OSSU's](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) amazing self-taught, open source education in Computer Science. 

**Why choose a self-taught education?**

- There is a large number of high quality resources that exist online. This curriculum includes a lot of courses from top universities (MIT, Stanford, University of San Francisco) as well as MOOCs that have been taken by millions of students.
- Flexibility: if I find a job during this process, I can easily switch to working full time, and continue studying part time. I can also study what I find most interesting.  
- I already have a Master's degree, even if it is in a unrelated field, and 8 years of experience working at various companies. Because of this, I feel that the self-taught path is more efficient for me. 
- I am a self-starter and have been learning in an auto didactic way all of my life. I know that this is a path that I can complete and succeed in.  

**My objectives with this coursework**
- Have real world practical projects that I am passionate about that I can demonstrate to future employers.
- Develop a strong knowledge base in math - this includes Linear algebra, calculus, statistics and probability theory. 
- Become a good developer that can program with strong software engineer and computer science foundations.  
- Be able to read scientific papers at the end of this curriculum and apply / redo the experiments on my own. 
- Share what I've learned through technical writing and be active in the community.

**Organization**. The curriculum is designed as follows:
- *Math and Programming Primer*: Get up to speed with the math and programming required for data science.
- *Core Data Science*: Corresponds roughly to a first year of master's degree in data science if we include some of the material in Core Math. 
- *Core Math*: Learn the math needed to understand data science at a deep and theoretical level.
- *Data Engineering Basics*: Not many university programs teach this but I think it is an essential topic to know in order to be operational in a work environment. 
- *Advanced Data Science*: Corresponds roughly to second year master's classes if we include some of the material in Math Foundations. Since I haven't started this section yet, it is incomplete, but the courses you will see are ones that have had the highest regards by the online community.   
- *Projects*: Personal projects I have undertaken to display my knowledge.

**Topics covered**:
`Introduction to AI`,
`Inferential statistics`,
`Descriptive statistics`,
`Introduction to Python`,
`Pandas`,
