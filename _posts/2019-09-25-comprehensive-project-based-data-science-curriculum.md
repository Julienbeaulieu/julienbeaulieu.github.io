## Summary

The following is a mix of project orientated learning and theory that I have studied or that I am currently studying in order to become a Data Scientist & a Deep Learning practitioner. My curriculum is intended to be a **complete education in data science** using online materials. I am currently studying this full time. 

My goal with this education is to make a complete career change into the field and to complement my business and marketing knowledge with tools to better analyze, predict, and uncover insights about real world problems. The hope is to join a startup I care about. 

This curriculum is inspired by [OSSU's](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) amazing self-taught, open source education in Computer Science. 

**Why choose a self-taught education?**

- Abundance of high quality resources: This curriculum includes a lot of courses from top universities (MIT, Stanford, University of San Francisco) as well as MOOCs that have been taken by millions of students and that have recieved outstanding reviews. 
- Focus on state of the art techniques: rarely does a university course teach state of the art technique such as ones found in [Fastai](https://fast.ai) for example. 
- Flexibility: easy to continue part time if I find a job during the process. 
- Passion: I can study and work on projects that I find the most interesting instead of being bound to a particular curriculum.  
- Existing degree & professional experience: I have 8 years of experience working at various companies and hold a Master degree. The self-taught path is more efficient for since I am already passionate about the field. 
- Self-starter: I have been learning in an auto didactic way all of my life. I know that this is a path that I can complete and succeed in.  

**My objectives with this coursework**

- Work on real world practical projects that I am passionate about. 
- Develop a strong knowledge base in math - this includes Linear algebra, calculus, statistics and probability theory. 
- Become a good developer with strong software engineer and computer science foundations.  
- Be able to read scientific papers and apply them or redo the experiments on my own. 
- Become a Deep Learning practitioner. 

**Organization**. The curriculum is designed as follows:
- *Math and Programming Primer*: Get up to speed with the math and programming required for data science.
- *Core Data Science*: Corresponds roughly to a first year of master's degree in data science if we include some of the material in Core Math. 
- *Core Math*: Learn the math needed to understand data science at a deep and theoretical level.
- *Deep Learning and Advanced Programming*: Corresponds roughly to second year master degree classes with an extra focus on Deep Learning and programming. 
- *Data Engineering Basics*: Not many university programs teach this but it is an essential to know how to be profitient un ML Ops and put a model in production.
- *Projects*: Personal projects I have undertaken to display my knowledge.

## Projects

Here I list the projects I have been working on and will be adding new ones as I advance in my curriculum. This is probably the most important part of the curriculum in my opinion. There isn't a predefined list of projects since everyone should choose their own projects to work on based on what they find interesting. 

Ex: My latest project involves ways of interpreting a model in a business context on a churn problem, in order to gain better insights and change business behavior. This is because as a former marketing professional, this is something I am very interested in. 

**Topics covered**:
`Computer vision`
`Standardized project structure`
`Telemetry with Tensorboard`
`Kaggle competition`
`Ensembling and stacking`
`Model interpretation`
`Partial dependence`
`Tree interpreter`
`Finite state machines`
`Technical writing`
