## Resources

Below are all the resources I have gathered to complete my Data Science training. This list will continue to be updated as I continue to discover more. 

<b>Curriculum</b>

- <a href="http://datasciencemasters.org/">http://datasciencemasters.org/</a> - A ton of amazing resources to complement my learnings. Must read for anyone planning to learn Data Science on their own.  
- <a href="https://learn.lambdaschool.com/syllabus/ds">Lambda school</a> – This page details everything that they teach in data science at Lambda School. I’ll be using this page to check if I have any holes in the curriculum I am creating for myself.  

<b>Online courses</b>

<b>Programming and Data Science</b>

- <a href="https://rmotr.com/data-science-python-course">RMOTR</a> – I recommend starting with RMOTR because it is focused on learning python fundamentals and Data Science libraries. Good teachers and community with a final project that you can add to your portfolio.  
- <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002">Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree</a> – With this program you'll learn to use Python, SQL, and statistics to uncover insights, communicate critical findings, and create data-driven solutions. Great place to start! Do not attempt the Data Science Nanodegree before completing this program unless you're already proficient in stats, probability, and python. 
- <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025">Udacity Data Science Nanodegree</a> – This program is focused on building practical Data Science projects such as recommendation engines, creating an image classifier, customer segments, etc.  
- <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027">Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree</a> – I believe it is important to know the basics of data modeling with PostgreSQL, Cloud data warehousing as well as big data ecosystem with Spark. 
- <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256">Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree</a> – Extremely important class for any data scientist.  
- <a href="https://www.udemy.com/web-scraping-with-python-beautifulsoup/">Web scrapping with Beautiful Soup</a> – Teaches you how to create your own dataset by scraping the Web. There are also free videos on YouTube as well as good articles on the subject. 
- <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">Fast.ai</a> – Focused on teaching machine learning and deep learning. This MOOC requires good programming knowledge. I intend to follow some classes later on since I’ve heard excellent feedback and it is recommended by a lot of people.  

<b>Linear Algebra, statistics and calculus</b>

- <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/">Linear Algebra</a> with Prof. Gilbert Strang from MIT. I can't recommend this lecture enough to get started with linear algebra. Prof. Gilbert Strang is a brilliant teacher that makes learning math fascinating. I went from not understanding linear algebra at all with other resources to loving it thanks to him.
- <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-005-highlights-of-calculus-spring-2010/index.htm">The big picture of Calculus</a> with Prof. Gilbert Strang. I am also a fan of his videos on calculus which are focused on the applications of calculus. So much better than any class I've ever had in school. 
- <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002">Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree</a> is really great for giving you the basics of statistics and probability. Must see before getting into machine learning. 
- <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/">Khanacademy’s</a> linear algebra, calculus, and statistics videos are all fine places to start. Books and videos in this list can complement your learning.
